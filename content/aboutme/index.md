## Hello, Iâ€™m ducdatdau.

Iâ€™m a hacker/security researcher from VietnamÂ ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³

During the day, I learn about cybersecurity at my university. At night and in my free time, I research IoT hardware, learn techniques to hack Linux kernel or write exploits for vulnerabilities. Sometimes, I play CTF with theÂ [TAS.DihydroMonoxide](https://ctftime.org/team/359392).

I plan to graduate in 2026 and am open to pursuing an MS or PhD if given the opportunity. This is my [resume](https://wru-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/2251272678_e_tlu_edu_vn/EVoRDiq9bVJBk2mWXTx9tuMB82_yumheVEgaKpi_eWSGBQ?e=10zwfE). Please let me know if it meets your requirements. Regards.
