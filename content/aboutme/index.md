# Hello, Iâ€™m ducdatdau.

Iâ€™m a hacker/security researcher from VietnamÂ ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³

During the day, I learn about cybersecurity at my university. At night and in my free time, I research IoT hardware, learn techniques to hack Linux kernel or write exploits for vulnerabilities. Sometimes, I play CTF with theÂ [TAS.DihydroMonoxide](https://ctftime.org/team/351063).

I plan to graduate in 2026 and am open to pursuing an MS or PhD if given the opportunity. This is my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tPDnYHNm_eOrDk3l_hYSKVN7cxioFHH3/view?usp=sharing). Please let me know if it meets your requirements. Regards.
