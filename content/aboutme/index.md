## PROFILE 

I am a final-year Cybersecurity student at Thuyloi University, specializing in automated vulnerability discovery with a strong focus on Fuzzing.

<!-- Building on a solid foundation in Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation, I specialize in analyzing low-level program behavior. Additionally, my interests extend to hardware-assisted security and the security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. -->

Building upon a strong foundation in Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation, my research focuses on the analysis of low-level program behaviors and system vulnerabilities. I am also interested in hardware-assisted security, the protection of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, and the emerging field of cybersecurity law and policy in Vietnam - areas in which I aspire to make meaningful academic and societal contributions in the future.
