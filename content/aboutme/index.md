Duc Dat Dau is a passionate security researcher and currently a third-year undergraduate student in Cybersecurity at Thuyloi University, Vietnam. He is recognized as the top-performing student in his department and was awarded a Bronze Medal in the Vietnam Student Mathematical Olympiad 2023.

His current research interests center around hardware and operating system security, including the exploitation of low-level vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel and embedded systems. He is particularly enthusiastic about reverse engineering and the systematic analysis of modern attack surfaces.

He plans to pursue a Master's degree (and potentially a Ph.D.) in Cybersecurity after his graduation in 2026. He is always open to research opportunities and collaborations in systems security.
