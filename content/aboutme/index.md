{{< admonition note >}}
I am prepared to begin graduate research at the Masterâ€™s or Ph.D. level immediately after my graduation in the summer of next year. If my research interests align with yours and you believe I may be a suitable candidate, please feel free to contact me using the information provided above.

After reading [this blog](https://andreas-zeller.info/2020/07/01/whats-it-like-to-be-a-phd-student-in-germany.html) by Prof. Andreas Zeller, I am especially excited about pursuing graduate study in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

## PROFILE 

Duc Dat Dau is a senior undergraduate student in Cyber Security at Thuyloi University, Vietnam.

His research interests focus on automated software vulnerability discovery, particularly fuzzing-based approaches for uncovering security flaws. He has a strong background in reverse engineering and binary exploitation, with an emphasis on analyzing and manipulating low-level program behavior. Beyond software, he is also interested in hardware-assisted security, with a specific focus on the security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
